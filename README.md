# Welcome to "Water Carbohydrate Solutions" repository!

Subject: Concentration and refrative index profile of inhomogeneous water-carbohydrate solutions.

Objectives: 
- Study optically active solutions (e.g. carbohydrates);
- Characterize the specific rotation coefficient;
- Get the concentration profile with respect to height variation of an inhomogeneous solution;
- Convert the concentration profile into refractive index.

Contents:
- "Experimental Data": Folder corresponding to the experimental data;
  - "Data - Calibration.xlsx": Excel sheet with the data to calculate the specific rotation coefficient of some carbohydrates;
  - "Data - Handbook.xlsx": Excel sheet with the data relating concentration and refractive index;
  - "Data - Varying Height - Sucrose.xlsx": Excel sheet with the data of the height profile of an inhomegenous solution;
- "Solution Analyser": Folder corresponding to the program analyser;
  - "Solution Analyser.py": Python code to run the analysis;
  - "Path Manager.txt": File with the path location of the folder with the experimental data sheets.

Instructions:
1) Put "Data - Calibration.xlsx", "Data - Handbook.xlsx" and "Data - Varying Height.xlsx" in the same folder;
2) Put "Path Manager.txt" and "Solution Analyser.py" in the same folder;
3) Write the path of the folder containg the data sheets on "Path Manager.txt";
4) Run "Solution Analyser.py".
